# Dark Web Monitoring with SpiderFoot

## Introduction
In this project, you will learn how to use SpiderFoot, an open-source intelligence automation tool, for dark web monitoring. SpiderFoot is a powerful tool that can be used to gather and analyze information from the dark web. You will set up SpiderFoot, configure it for dark web monitoring, and perform various exercises to understand its capabilities.

## Lab Setup
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 recommended)
- **Tools Required**: SpiderFoot, Tor Browser

### Tool Installation

#### 1. Installing Tor
- To access the dark web, you need to install the Tor browser.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor
```
- Start the Tor service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

#### 2. Installing SpiderFoot
- Install SpiderFoot by following these steps:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip
git clone https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git
cd spiderfoot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run SpiderFoot:

```bash
python3 sf.py
```
- Access SpiderFoot via a web browser at http://localhost:5001.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Configuring SpiderFoot for Dark Web Monitoring
1. Open SpiderFoot: Navigate to http://localhost:5001 in your web browser.
2. Create a New Scan: Click on "New Scan".
3. Set Scan Target: Enter a target domain or keyword related to your dark web interest.
4. Configure Modules: Enable modules related to the dark web. For instance, enable the tor module.
5. Start Scan: Click "Run Scan" and monitor the progress.

**Expected Output**
- You should see a list of discovered data related to your target, including links and content from dark web sites.

### Exercise 2: Analyzing Dark Web Data
1. View Scan Results: After the scan completes, click on the scan ID to view results.
2. Filter Results: Use the filter options to focus on dark web results.
3. Analyze Data: Look for any relevant information such as hidden services, exposed credentials, or other sensitive data.

**Expected Output**
- A detailed report containing data from dark web sources related to your target.

### Exercise 3: Automating Dark Web Monitoring
- Schedule Scans: Use SpiderFoot's scheduling feature to run scans at regular intervals.
- Configure Notifications: Set up email notifications for scan results.

**Expected Output**
- Regularly updated scan results delivered to your email, keeping you informed about any new findings on the dark web.

### Exercise 4: Integrating SpiderFoot with Other Tools
- Export Data: Export SpiderFoot scan results in various formats (CSV, JSON).
- Integrate with SIEM: Import the data into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool like Splunk or ELK stack for further analysis.

**Expected Output**
- A comprehensive dashboard in your SIEM tool displaying dark web monitoring data.

### Exercise 5: Customizing SpiderFoot Modules
- Develop Custom Modules: Create custom Python modules for SpiderFoot to extend its functionality.
- Deploy Modules: Add the custom modules to the SpiderFoot modules directory and run a scan.

**Expected Output**
- Newly discovered data based on the custom module, enhancing the capabilities of your dark web monitoring.

## Conclusion
By completing these exercises, you have learned how to set up and use SpiderFoot for dark web monitoring, analyze the collected data, automate the process, integrate with other tools, and customize its functionality. This hands-on experience equips you with practical skills in dark web intelligence gathering and analysis.
