# Building a Dark Web Monitoring Tool with Maltego

## Introduction
In this project, you will learn how to use Maltego, a powerful open-source intelligence and forensics application, to build a dark web monitoring tool. Maltego allows for data mining and link analysis, making it ideal for investigating the dark web. You will set up Maltego, configure it for dark web monitoring, and perform various exercises to harness its capabilities.

## Lab Setup
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 recommended)
- **Tools Required**: Maltego, Tor

### Tool Installation

#### 1. Installing Tor
- To access the dark web, you need to install the Tor browser.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor
```
- Start the Tor service:

``bash
sudo systemctl start tor
sudo systemctl enable tor
```
#### 2. Installing Maltego
- Download and install Maltego from the official website: Maltego Downloads

- After downloading the appropriate version for your OS, install Maltego:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i maltego_v4.x.x.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up Maltego for Dark Web Monitoring
1. Open Maltego: Launch Maltego from your applications menu.
2. Create a New Graph: Click on "Create New Graph".
3. Add Entities: Start by adding entities like "Person", "Domain", or "URL" that you want to investigate.
4. Configure Transforms: Configure transforms related to dark web investigation. You can find and install relevant transforms from the Maltego Transform Hub.

**Expected Output**
- A Maltego graph with initial entities and configured transforms ready for investigation.

### Exercise 2: Using Tor with Maltego
1. Configure Maltego to Use Tor:

- In Maltego, go to the "Settings" menu.
- Navigate to "Proxy Settings".
- Set the proxy type to SOCKS5 with the address 127.0.0.1 and port 9050.

2. Verify Connection: Test the connection to ensure that Maltego traffic is routed through Tor.

**Expected Output**
- Maltego configured to route its traffic through the Tor network.

### Exercise 3: Running Dark Web Transforms
1. Add Dark Web Entities: Add specific .onion URLs or other dark web entities to your graph.
2. Run Transforms: Execute transforms to gather information about these entities. Use transforms like "To URL" or "To Website [HTML Title]" to explore the dark web entities.
3. Analyze Results: Review the results returned by the transforms, such as additional linked .onion sites, metadata, or discovered connections.

**Expected Output**
- A populated graph with data from dark web entities and their connections.

### Exercise 4: Visualizing Dark Web Connections
1. Expand the Graph: Use the results from previous transforms to add more entities to the graph.
2. Apply Layouts: Use Maltego's layout options to organize the graph for better visualization.
3. Analyze Links: Examine the connections between entities to identify patterns, relationships, or potential threats.

Expected Output
- A well-organized graph visually representing connections between various dark web entities.

### Exercise 5: Automating Dark Web Monitoring with Maltego
1. Create Custom Transforms: Develop custom transforms in Python to automate specific dark web monitoring tasks.
2. Integrate Custom Transforms: Add these custom transforms to Maltego and use them in your graph.
3. Schedule Transform Runs: Use Maltego's scheduling feature to run your transforms at regular intervals for continuous monitoring.

Example Custom Transform
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def darkweb_scrape(url):
    session = requests.Session()
    session.proxies = {'http': 'socks5h://localhost:9050', 'https': 'socks5h://localhost:9050'}
    response = session.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    titles = [title.get_text() for title in soup.find_all('title')]
    return titles

# Example usage
print(darkweb_scrape('http://example.onion'))
```

**Expected Output**
- Automated and scheduled dark web monitoring with Maltego, producing regular updates to your graph.

## Conclusion
By completing these exercises, you have learned how to set up and use Maltego for dark web monitoring, configure it to use Tor, run and analyze dark web transforms, visualize connections, and automate the monitoring process. This hands-on experience equips you with practical skills in dark web intelligence gathering and analysis using Maltego.
